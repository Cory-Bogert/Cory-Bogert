I'm a recent App Academy graduate that is currently in the job search. I am on the verge of being a father which I am very excited about and love anything outside and hockey. 
I’m currently working on a lululemon clone. It currently has several features including cart and reviews but trying to add more over the following weeks which can be found here https://lulumelon.onrender.com/ Would love any feedback!
My current tech stack is JS, Python, React/Redux, Flask, CSS and HTML, and Sql
