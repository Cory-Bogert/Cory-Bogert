## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cory Bogert
### I'm from St. Louis, MO and I can be reached at bogert.cory@gmail.com
I'm a recent App Academy graduate that is currently in the job search. I am on the verge of being a father which I am very excited about and love anything outside and hockey. 
Iâ€™m currently working on a lululemon clone. It currently has several features including cart and reviews but trying to add more over the following weeks which can be found here https://lulumelon.onrender.com/ Would love any feedback!
My current tech stack is JS, Python, React/Redux, Flask, CSS and HTML, and Sql. Really looking forward to diving into some Rust in the near future and possibly pick up Tailwind. Drop a follow on my Linkedin and I'll be sure to follow back! Thanks for looking at my profile.
